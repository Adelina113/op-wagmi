Use Viem 2 stable release, remove OpConfig and rely on wagmi config.

OpConfigs can be removed from the project and the wagmi config can be used instead. This will allow for a more streamlined configuration process. Please see the configuration documentation for more information. https://www.opwagmi.sh/docs/configuration.html
